**Version**: 1.0.4

## Overview
For this lab assignment, you will use the latitude and longitude to request information about movies related to the area, yelp info, and hiking trails and campgrounds near the location.  

## Getting Started
When users want to build this app on their own machine, they first go to our GitHub page and git clone the app to their local repo. Then in their local repo, create a file called .env and inside .env file, put the exact wording that is inside the single quotes 'PORT=3000' into the file. Then in their terminal, run npm -i. This will install all the dependencies with the same versions we use on our app that are also listed in the package.json file to their local machine so they can run our app.
